                        Intergas Pty Ltd (“Intergas”) confirms that its inaugural supply contract with
                        PPG South East Energy LLC (“PPG”) has officially entered the negotiation phase.
                        This milestone marks an important step in establishing Intergas as an active
                        participant in the Australian energy market and reflects the disciplined,
                        structured approach the company applies to all commercial engagements.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        The negotiation phase involves finalising the technical, commercial, and
                        regulatory terms of the supply agreement, ensuring alignment with Australian
                        market requirements, logistical considerations, and compliance obligations.
                        Intergas is committed to executing agreements that support reliability,
                        transparency, and practical deliverability, consistent with the expectations
                        of counterparties and the broader energy sector.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Australia’s east-coast gas market continues to experience tightening supply
                        conditions, as highlighted by the Australian Energy Market Operator. Reliable
                        access to flexible and internationally sourced supply is increasingly relevant
                        to supporting both industrial and residential demand. Intergas’s efforts to
                        secure a formal supply agreement are undertaken with this context in mind,
                        seeking to enhance market resilience while complementing domestic supply.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Once finalised, the agreement will allow Intergas to engage with potential
                        buyers and counterparties, facilitating structured physical energy transactions
                        in alignment with market rules and operational constraints. The company’s
                        approach ensures that all subsequent activity is commercially sound, technically
                        robust, and consistent with the standards of established international energy
                        participants.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Intergas continues to advance its market capability with the discipline,
                        scale, and operational rigor expected of global energy companies. The
                        commencement of the negotiation phase represents a key milestone in building
                        Intergas’s presence, credibility, and capacity to contribute to Australia’s
                        energy security and market efficiency.
