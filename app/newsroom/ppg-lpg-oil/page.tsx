                        Intergas Pty Ltd (“Intergas”) has received approval from PPG South East Energy
                        LLC (“PPG”) to expand the scope of its brokerage activities to include LPG and
                        crude oil products. This development reflects the continued evolution of the
                        relationship between Intergas and PPG and supports Intergas’s strategy of
                        providing broader market access and execution capability across a range of
                        physical energy commodities.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Australia’s energy and fuel markets are increasingly influenced by global
                        supply dynamics, infrastructure constraints, and geopolitical developments.
                        In addition to natural gas, products such as LPG and crude oil remain critical
                        to Australia’s energy security, supporting household energy needs, industrial
                        activity, transport fuels, and refining operations. Ensuring reliable access
                        to internationally sourced supply continues to be a key consideration for
                        market participants and policymakers.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Intergas’s expanded brokerage mandate encompasses the physical marketing and
                        execution of LPG and crude oil transactions, with a focus on supply reliability,
                        specification compatibility, logistics, and alignment with Australian
                        regulatory and operational requirements. Intergas approaches these markets
                        with the same disciplined framework applied to gas and LNG, prioritising
                        transparent execution and practical deliverability.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        The inclusion of LPG and crude oil within Intergas’s brokerage operations
                        complements the company’s existing activities across gas and LNG markets and
                        reflects a broader recognition that energy security extends beyond electricity
                        generation alone. Diversified access to global energy commodities contributes
                        to system resilience and supports continuity of supply across multiple sectors
                        of the Australian economy.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Through its relationship with PPG, Intergas is able to engage with a wider
                        network of international producers, traders, and end-users, strengthening its
                        ability to structure and execute transactions that respond to evolving market
                        conditions. This expanded scope enhances Intergas’s capacity to support
                        Australian counterparties in navigating increasingly complex global energy
                        markets.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Intergas continues to develop its brokerage capabilities in line with the
                        standards and expectations of established international energy participants.
                        The expansion of its mandate to include LPG and crude oil reflects Intergas’s
                        commitment to building scale, depth, and relevance across global energy
                        markets while supporting Australia’s broader energy security objectives.
