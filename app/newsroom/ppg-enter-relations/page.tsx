                        Intergas Pty Ltd (“Intergas”) announces that it has entered into a brokerage
                        relationship with PPG South East Energy LLC (“PPG”), further strengthening
                        Intergas’s international market presence and its capacity to support the
                        execution of physical energy transactions across global supply chains. The
                        relationship reflects Intergas’s continued focus on energy security, market
                        integrity, and the responsible facilitation of cross-border energy flows in
                        support of Australia’s evolving energy system.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Australia’s east-coast gas market is undergoing structural change. Declining
                        production from legacy basins, increasing exposure to global price signals,
                        and growing demand variability driven by renewable integration have heightened
                        the importance of supply flexibility and system resilience. The Australian
                        Energy Market Operator has consistently highlighted the role of firm and
                        dispatchable gas supply in maintaining reliability across the National
                        Electricity Market, particularly during periods of peak demand and adverse
                        weather conditions.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        In this context, access to international energy markets and diversified sources
                        of supply is increasingly relevant. Intergas operates at the intersection of
                        global supply and regional demand, facilitating the physical movement of energy
                        commodities, including natural gas and LNG, into markets where domestic supply
                        constraints and infrastructure limitations create challenges for reliability
                        and affordability. Intergas’s activities are focused on the practical execution
                        of physical transactions, supporting counterparties through structured,
                        transparent, and commercially disciplined market engagement.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        This approach is consistent with the policy and market perspectives articulated
                        by AEMO and industry participants, including Squadron Energy, which recognise
                        that gas continues to play a critical role in Australia’s energy mix during the
                        transition to lower-emissions generation. While renewable capacity will continue
                        to expand, firm energy remains essential to balancing intermittency, supporting
                        system security, and ensuring continuity of supply for industrial users and
                        essential services.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        The brokerage relationship with PPG enhances Intergas’s ability to engage with a
                        broader network of international producers, intermediaries, and end-users,
                        particularly in key supply regions. PPG’s experience in physical energy markets
                        complements Intergas’s regional execution capabilities, enabling more efficient
                        structuring of transactions that align with Australian regulatory frameworks,
                        logistical requirements, and evolving market conditions.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Intergas approaches energy markets with the discipline and long-term perspective
                        expected of established international energy participants. Through strategic
                        partnerships and active engagement with global supply networks, Intergas seeks
                        to contribute to a resilient and well-functioning energy system that supports
                        Australia’s economic stability and energy transition objectives. The relationship
                        with PPG reflects this commitment and Intergas’s continued investment in
                        capability, scale, and market relevance.
