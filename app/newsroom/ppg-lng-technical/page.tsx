                        Intergas Pty Ltd (“Intergas”) has completed a technical assessment of LNG
                        volumes marketed by PPG South East Energy LLC (“PPG”) for potential delivery
                        into the Australian market. The assessment forms part of Intergas’s broader
                        due diligence framework, focused on ensuring that prospective international
                        supply options are compatible with Australia’s regulatory, technical, and
                        operational requirements.

                    <p>
                        Australia’s east-coast gas market continues to face structural challenges
                        associated with declining domestic production, infrastructure constraints,
                        and increasing demand volatility. The Australian Energy Market Operator has
                        consistently identified the importance of firm and flexible gas supply in
                        maintaining system reliability across the National Electricity Market,
                        particularly as renewable penetration increases and weather-driven demand
                        events become more pronounced.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Intergas’s technical assessment considered a range of factors relevant to
                        the Australian context, including LNG specification compatibility, shipping
                        and delivery logistics, scheduling flexibility, and alignment with domestic
                        market and regulatory settings. The review was undertaken with a focus on
                        physical execution and operational feasibility, reflecting Intergas’s role
                        as an active participant in international energy markets.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        The assessment aligns with broader industry recognition, including views
                        articulated by Squadron Energy, that gas will continue to play an essential
                        role in supporting system security and reliability during Australia’s energy
                        transition. Access to diversified and internationally sourced LNG supply
                        can provide an additional layer of resilience for the east-coast market,
                        particularly during periods of peak demand or supply disruption.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Completion of this assessment enhances Intergas’s ability to engage with
                        Australian counterparties on potential import solutions that are technically
                        robust and commercially credible. Through disciplined evaluation and close
                        engagement with international suppliers such as PPG, Intergas seeks to
                        support market outcomes that contribute to energy security, transparency,
                        and system resilience.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        Intergas continues to approach international energy opportunities with the
                        technical rigor and operational discipline expected of established global
                        energy participants. The completion of this assessment reflects Intergas’s
                        ongoing investment in capability and its commitment to supporting Australia’s
                        energy system as it adapts to changing supply and demand dynamics.
